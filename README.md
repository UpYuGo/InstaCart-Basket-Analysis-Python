<h1>Instacart Basket Analysis-Python</h1>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
This repository showcases an exploratory analysis of Instacart's sales data, focusing on identifying customer buying patterns to support a targeted marketing approach. As an analyst for Instacart, my objective is to uncover insights on different customer segments and their purchasing behaviors. By analyzing this data, I aim to identify unique customer profiles that will guide Instacart in personalizing its marketing campaigns, maximizing product sales, and increasing customer engagement on the platform.   

<h2>Key Questions</h2>

 - The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the
 day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at
 times when there are fewer orders.     
 - They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people
 spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at
 these times.    
 - Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to
 use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.    
 - Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing
 and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of
 product orders.    
 - The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of
 customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. For example:   
 
 1. What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
 often do they return to Instacart)?    
 2. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?    
 3. Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?    
 4. Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
 habits?    
 5. What different classifications does the demographic information suggest?
 Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?    
 6. What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer
 profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products
 customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
